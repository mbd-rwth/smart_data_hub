# Smart Data Hub
Welcome to the smart data hub repository, developed by the [Methods for Model-based Development in Computational Engineering](https://www.mbd.rwth-aachen.de/) (MBD) and 
[Geophysical Imaging and Monitoring](https://www.gim.rwth-aachen.de/) (GIM) groups at RWTH Aachen University. The smart 
data hub is a product of the '[Smart-Monitoring](https://www.mbd.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/sxklc?lidx=1#aaaaaaaaaasxkoh)' project,
which aims to provide innovative solutions in data-integrated simulation studies: scenario-based, uncertainty-integrated database.

## Data Hub Architecture
The data-hub consists of a database integrated with a Graphic User Interface (GUI).
1. **Database**: It provides material properties along with their uncertainty margins and sensible defaults 
in YAML files. All relevant files can be found in the [`database`](./database/README.md) directory.
2. **GUI**: It was developed with [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)—a web-based application for interactive visualization. Simply run the Python program [SmartGUI.py](./SmartGUI.py), it will then start a local flask server.
The GUI displays three sections:
   * Geomodel: provides a 3D structural geomodel for each site.
   * Chronostratigraphic chart & Table: The chart indicates geological formation time of each stratum. The table provides information on rock properties.
   * Processing buttons: enables merging and tagging data, adding sensible defaults, and exporting files.

## Installation (For GUI)
1. Download the zip file or clone the repository:
2. Create a conda environment using ``environment.yml`` and running the following command ``conda env create -f environment.yml``, 
3. Activate the environment with ``conda activate smart_data_hub``.
